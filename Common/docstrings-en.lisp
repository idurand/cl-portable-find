              Description:~@
              The resulting sequence is constructed by treating SEQUENCE-1 and SEQUENCE-2~@
              as two stacks, successively popping one of the two top elements and adding it~@
              to the end of the resulting sequence.  When both stacks are empty, the resulting~@
              sequence is returned. If one of the stacks is empty, the other one is popped.~@
              If neither stack is empty, the top of the stack represented by SEQUENCE-1 is~@
              used as the first argument of PREDICATE, and the top of the stack represented by~@
              SEQUENCE-2 is used as the second argument of PREDICATE.  If PREDICATE returns true,~@
              then the stack represented by SEQUENCE-1 is popped, otherwise, the stack represented~@
              by SEQUENCE-2 is popped.~@
              ~@
              From the description above follows that the resulting sequence contains each element~@
              of SEQUENCE-1 exactly once, and each element of SEQUENCE-2 exactly once.  Furthermore,~@
              it follows that the relative order of two elements in SEQUENCE-1 is preserved in the~@
              resulting sequence, and that the relative order of two elements in SEQUENCE-1 is~@
              preserved in the resulting sequence.~@
              ~@
              Furthermore, it follows that if PREDICATE represents the strictly-less-than function~@
              of a total order between the elements of SEQUENCE-1 and SEQUENCE-2, and if SEQUENCE-1~@
              and SEQUENCE-2 are both sorted according to this total order, then the resulting~@
              sequence will also be sorted according to that order.  In addition, the merge operation~@
              is stable in this case, i.e., if an element of SEQUENCE-1 is equal to an element of~@
              SEQUENCE-2 according to this total order, then the element of SEQUENCE-1 will occur~@
              before the element of SEQUENCE-2 in the resulting sequence.  For PREDICATE to represent~@
              the strictly-less-than function of a total order, it must always return the same value~@
              for a given pair of arguments. Also, (funcall PREDICATE x y) and (funcall PREDICATE y x)~@
              must never both return true, and if both return false, then x and y are considired equal~@
              with respect to the total order.~@

              If RESULT-TYPE is a subtype of LIST, then the resulting sequence will~@
              be a LIST.~@
              If RESULT-TYPE is a subtype of VECTOR, then if the element type ~@
              specified for RESULT-TYPE can be determined, the element type of~@
              the resulting array is the result of upgrading that element type,~@

              SEQUENCE-1 and SEQUENCE-2 are considered sorted according to PREDICATE~@
              then if some element in SEQUENCE-1 is equal to some element in SEQUENCE-2~@
              according to PREDICATE, then the element in SEQUENCE-1 will precede the~@

              thus destructively modifying it.  Thus, after a MERGE operation, the contents of~@
              such a sequence will be unpredictable, and should not be used.~@

              SEQUENCE-2 is a proper sequence.~@
              PREDICATE is a designator for a function that must accept two arguments~@

              KEY is a designator for a function that must accept one argument and~@
              that is applied to the elements of SEQUENCE-1 and of SEQUENCE-2 before~@
              the test is applied, or KEY could be NIL which means IDENTITY.~@
              The default value of KEY is NIL.~@

              Exceptional situations:~@
              An error of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled if RESULT-TYPE is neither a~@
              recognizable subtype of LIST nor a recognizable subtype of VECTOR.~@
              An error of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled if RESULT-TYPE specifies a~@
              size and that size is different from the sum of the lengths of~@
              SEQUENCE-1 and SEQUENCE-2.~@
              An error of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled if SEQUENCE-1 is not a SEQUENCE.~@
              An error of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled if SEQUENCE-1 is a dotted list.~@
              No error is signaled if SEQUENCE-1 is a circular list.~@
              An error of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled if SEQUENCE-2 is not a SEQUENCE.~@
              An error of type TYPE-ERROR is signaled if SEQUENCE-2 is a dotted list.~@
              No error is signaled if SEQUENCE-2 is a circular list.~@
              ~@
              Portability notes:~@
              The Common Lisp HyperSpec does not explicity mention that the SEQUENCE-1~@
              and SEQUENCE-2 must be proper sequences, and only says that they have to be~@
              sequences.  However, section 17.1.1 states that they still have to be~@
              proper sequences.~@
              The Common Lisp HyperSpec does not state what happens if SEQUENCE-1~@
              or SEQUENCE0-2 is not a proper sequence.  This omission implicitly means~@
              that the behavior is undefined in this case.  For that reason, portable~@
              code should not assume that any errors are signaled if this restriction~@
              is violated.~@

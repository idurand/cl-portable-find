;;; A version of POSITION, specialized to a vector.  ITEM is the item
;;; for wich a position is searched for. VECTOR is the vector to
;;; search.  FROM-END is a generalized Boolean indicating the
;;; direction of the search.  At least one of TEST and TEST-NOT must
;;; be NIL.  If both are NIL it is as if TEST had the value #'EQL.  If
;;; one of TEST and TEST-NOT is not NIL, it must be a designator for a
;;; function.  START and END must be non-negative fixnums.  KEY must
;;; be a designator for function.
